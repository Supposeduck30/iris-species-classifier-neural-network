# Iris Species Classifier Neural Network
## A fully functional neural network written in Python using that learns how to identify different iris species
This project demonstrates a neural network built with TensorFlow that learns how to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on sepal and petal measurements. This project:
- Implements an iris dataset with 150 samples
- Trains a neural network with TensorFlow/Keras
- Predict which species a flower belongs to (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica)
- Visualizing accuracy every 25 epochs
### Species and their features:
####  Each sample includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
#### The model learns from these four features to predict the species of the iris.

## Version History
### 1.0.0
- Terminal based
- Trains over 150 epochs
- Prints progress every 25 epochs
- Displays 5 predictions of 5 randomly selected flowers from the data set

## How to run
